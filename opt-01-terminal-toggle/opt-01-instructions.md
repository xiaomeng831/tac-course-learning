# Configure the VSCode terminal to maximize with a keyboard shortcut

- Go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts: (Ctrl+k, Ctrl+s) 
- Search for the following item: 

  workbench.action.toggleMaximizedPanel

- Add a shortcut of your choice. 
- Test the shortcut toggle. This should allow you to maximize the terminal (hiding the code pane) and restore it back to where it was.
